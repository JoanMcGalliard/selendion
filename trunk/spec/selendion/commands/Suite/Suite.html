<h1>Suite</h1>

<p> You can run Selendion tests in suites by adding then to a suite and subsequently running that suite.
</p>

<p>
    We can add html files and directories to a suite. If a directory is added, then all the html files in that
    directory will become part of the suite. When we run a suite, for each html file it looks for a class
    that has the same name + "Test". If that exists, it is run, otherwise it looks for a class with the same
    name as html file and runs that. If the class is found, it must be a subclass of SelendionTestCase.
    Finally, if neither is found, it <a href="SuiteWithoutClass.html"> creates a class, based on the current class,
    for the test</a>.
